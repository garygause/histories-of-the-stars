## Prolog

![](img/double.jpg)

I admit it.  I have a love for stars.  As an astrophotographer, I have many targets I can choose from on any given night, and there is so much beauty in the universe, it is a hard decision. But I have always had a fascination with stars.  They are, after all, the home of planets and the destination of explorers.  With this book, I am attempting to convey some of that fascination.  I hope you enjoy.
