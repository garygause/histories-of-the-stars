intro: 
Arcturus is the brightest star in the northern hemisphere.  

location:
Close to earth.  Nearby stars include Eta Bootis (3.3 ly).  It is moving rapidly towards earth (proper motion = 2 arc seconds per year).  It is part of a group of 52 stars that appear to be moving together known as the Arcturus stream.

history:
Arcturus is currently in the late stages of the main sequence.  It has likely exhausted all its hydrogen fuel and is in hydrogen shell burning phase.  It has expanded into a giant star and is likely to continue expanding as it ages and dies.

future:
Arcturus has likely already begun fusing helium into oxygen and carbon in its core.  This stage occurs after most of the hydrogen fuel has been consumned and leads to a swelling or expansion of the star into a giant star.  

As an aging star, Arcturus exhibits very little instability.  "Star quakes" have been deteced on the order of microseconds to a few seconds at most.  This is common in red giants as they age.  The surface of the star actually vibrates creating short-scale variations it the spectral signature.  As the star ages towards the M class of stars, it's variability and thus its instability will increase.

After its helium supply is exhausted, it will expand further, eject its outer shells of gas, and become a white dwarf star inside a planetary nebula.

Arcturus is moving closer to the sun at a rapid rate.  In about 4000 years, it will be at its closest point to Earth, a few hundredths of a light year closer than it is now.
